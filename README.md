I was out of town for this assignment and had some trouble with uploading it to GitHub. I talked to you in person about being absent, and I also sent you an email about working alone instead of with a partner since I wouldn't be there in person. I submitted my original repository before the due date, but realized the files were set up incorrectly, so here are the correct files. If anything is missing please let me know.
